The lab will be the highly collaborative, vibrant, and engaged Department of Biology (<a href="https://bio.jhu.edu/">here </a>). 

Anyone interested in technician, post-doc, or staff scientist positions should email Erik. Interested graduate students should apply to the CMDB program (<a href="https://cmdb.jhu.edu/">here </a>). 

We are very excited to move to this new university and community!
