This funding will allow the Andersen lab in collaboration with <a href="http://people.biology.ufl.edu/cbaer/Baer_lab/Home.html">Dr. Charlie Baer's lab</a> to investigate how randomly accumulated mutations contribute to the fitness of the <em>C. elegans</em> experimental system. We will also investigate the spectrum of variation found in natural strains to gauge fitness effects in the wild.
