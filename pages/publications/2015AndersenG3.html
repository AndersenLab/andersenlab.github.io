<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>The genetic variants underlying complex traits are often elusive even in powerful model
organisms such as <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> with controlled genetic backgrounds and environmental conditions.
Two major contributing factors are: (1) the lack of statistical power from measuring the phenotypes of small
numbers of individuals, and (2) the use of phenotyping platforms that do not scale to hundreds of individuals
and are prone to noisy measurements. Here, we generated a new resource of 359 recombinant inbred strains
that augments the existing <em>C. elegans</em> N2xCB4856 recombinant inbred advanced intercross line population.
This new strain collection removes variation in the neuropeptide receptor gene npr-1, known to have large
physiological and behavioral effects on <em>C. elegans</em> and mitigates the hybrid strain incompatibility caused by zeel-1 and peel-1, allowing for identification of quantitative trait loci that otherwise would have been masked by those effects. Additionally, we optimized highly scalable and accurate high-throughput assays of fecundity and
body size using the COPAS BIOSORT large particle nematode sorter. Using these assays, we identified
quantitative trait loci involved in fecundity and growth under normal growth conditions and after exposure
to the herbicide paraquat, including independent genetic loci that regulate different stages of larval growth.
Our results offer a powerful platform for the discovery of the genetic variants that control differences in
responses to drugs, other aqueous compounds, bacterial foods, and pathogenic stresses</p>
