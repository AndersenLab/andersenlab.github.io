<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Many chemotherapeutic drugs are differentially effective from one patient to the next.
Understanding the causes of this variability is a critical step towards the development of
personalized treatments and improvements to existing medications. Here, we investigate
sensitivity to a group of anti-neoplastic drugs that target topoisomerase II using the model
organism <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em>. We show that wild strains of <em>C. elegans</em> vary in their sensitivity
to these drugs, and we use an unbiased genetic approach to demonstrate that this
natural variation is explained by a methionine-to-glutamine substitution in topoisomerase
II (TOP-2). The presence of a non-polar methionine at this residue increases hydrophobic
interactions between TOP-2 and its poison etoposide, as compared to a polar glutamine.
We hypothesize that this stabilizing interaction results in increased genomic instability in
strains that contain a methionine residue. The residue affected by this substitution is conserved
from yeast to humans and is one of the few differences between the two human topoisomerase
II isoforms (methionine in hTOPIIα and glutamine in hTOPIIβ). We go on to show
that this amino acid difference between the two human topoisomerase isoforms influences
cytotoxicity of topoisomerase II poisons in human cell lines. These results explain why hTOPIIα
and hTOPIIβ are differentially affected by various poisons and demonstrate the utility of
<em>C. elegans</em> in understanding the genetics of drug responses.</p>
