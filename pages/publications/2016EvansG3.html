<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Species inhabit a variety of environmental niches, and the adaptation to a particular niche is
often controlled by genetic factors, including gene-by-environment interactions. The genes that vary in order
to regulate the ability to colonize a niche are often difficult to identify, especially in the context of complex
ecological systems and in experimentally uncontrolled natural environments. Quantitative genetic approaches
provide an opportunity to investigate correlations between genetic factors and environmental parameters that
might define a niche. Previously, we have shown how a collection of 208 whole-genome sequenced wild
<em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> can facilitate association mapping approaches. To correlate climate parameters with
the variation found in this collection of wild strains, we used geographic data to exhaustively curate daily
weather measurements in short-term (3 month), middle-term (one year), and long-term (three year) durations
surrounding the date of strain isolation. These climate parameters were used as quantitative traits in association
mapping approaches, where we identified 11 quantitative trait loci (QTL) for three climatic variables:
elevation, relative humidity, and average temperature. We then narrowed the genomic interval of interest to
identify gene candidates with variants potentially underlying phenotypic differences. Additionally, we performed
two-strain competition assays at high and low temperatures to validate a QTL that could underlie
adaptation to temperature and found suggestive evidence supporting that hypothesis.</p>
