<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Telomeres are involved in the maintenance of chromosomes and the prevention of genome instability. Given this central importance, it is surprising that variation in telomere length has been observed in a variety of organisms. The genetic determinants of telomere-length variation and their effects on organismal fitness are largely unexplored. Here, we describe natural variation in telomere length across the <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> species. We identify a large-effect variant that contributes to differences in telomere length. The variant alters the conserved  oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide-binding fold of POT-2, a homolog of a human telomere-capping shelterin complex subunit. Mutations within this domain likely reduce the ability of POT-2 to bind telomeric DNA, thereby increasing telomere length. We examine the effect of telomere-length variation on offspring production and longevity in <em>C. elegans</em> wild isolates. Our results support the hypothesis that naturally long telomeres play a limited role in modifying fitness phenotypes in <em>C. elegans</em>.</p>
