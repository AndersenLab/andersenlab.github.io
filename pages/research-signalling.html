<p><em>C. elegans</em> is a powerful model to identify the genes and mechanisms for cell-fate specification. Recent results show that the canonical pathways found in the laboratory strain (N2) vary within natural populations. Individual members of the pathway have different activities or are modified by novel factors. We aim to determine how these new networks are wired as compared to the classic examples.</p>

<p>Using quantitative assays of vulval development, dauer formation, and stress responses, we probe the conserved Ras, Notch, Wnt, TGF-beta, insulin signaling pathways for variation within the <em>C. elegans</em> species. Once we identify these variant genes, we can determine the mechanisms for how natural populations vary in canonical signaling pathways. These results might shed light on the important genes that vary most in human populations to cause differences in development and/or disease.</p>
