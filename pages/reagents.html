<h3>QX1430xCB4856 RIAILs (QX240-QX598)</h3>

<img src="/assets/img/research/QX1430_CB4856_RIAILS.jpg" class="thumbnail img-responsive" />

<p>We can distribute RIAILs from <a href="http://andersenlab.org/pub/2015G3.pdf">Andersen <em>et al</em>.</a> Please <a href="/Contact/">contact Erik</a> with a short description of your assay and needs. In most cases, we send 20 RIAILs along with QX1430 and CB4856 parents to determine heritability. Please supply shipping information.</p>

<h3>N2xCB4856 RIAILs (QX1-QX239)</h3>

<img src="/assets/img/research/N2_CB4856_RIAILS.png" class="thumbnail img-responsive" />


<p>We can distribute RIAILs from <a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000419">Rockman <em>et al.</em></a> Please <a href="/Contact/">contact Erik</a> with a short description of your assay and needs. In most cases, we send 20 RIAILs, our N2 and CB4856 parents, and <em>npr-1</em> nearly isogenic lines to (1) determine heritability and (2) rule out <em>npr-1</em> as a likely causative locus. Please supply shipping information.</p>
