To map differences in quantitative traits, we use high-throughput assays to rapidly measure gene-by-environment interactions across large collections of natural <em>C. elegans</em>, <em>C. briggsae</em>, and <em>C. tropicalis</em> strains. These assays measure fecundity, growth rates, behaviors, and pharyngeal pumping rates after exposure to chemotherapeutics, toxicants, and other compounds. Each trait allows us to determine different effects on the physiology of the animals. These high-throughput assays give us the ability to identify natural variants or induced mutations at unprecedented speeds and with high statistical power. To enable the connections between genotypic and phenotypic variation, we created a new genome-wide association mapping package called [NemaScan](https://github.com/AndersenLab/NemaScan).
