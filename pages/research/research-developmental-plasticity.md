Organisms must adapt to changing environments like temperature and food availability. <em>Caenorhabditis</em> nematodes enter an alternative developmental stage when poor conditions are encountered. Using novel high-throughput assays, we found that natural populations vary in their propensity to enter this alternative developmental stage. Additionally, in collaboration with the Schroeder lab (Cornell Univ.), we found that nematodes produce varying amounts of the chemical cues that induce the alternative developmental stage. Taken together, we hope to understand how nematodes adapt to environmental cues.
