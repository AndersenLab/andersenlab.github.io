The phenotype of an organism is determined by both genetic and environmental factors. Additionally, we know that some genetic factors only have effects on the phenotype of an organism in certain environments. Understanding these gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions at the molecular level will likely inform us about how organisms respond to shifting environments.

In an effort to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings for a large number GxE interactions, we used our high-throughput assays (here - link to that page) to measure fecundity, growth rate, and pharyngeal pumping in different bacterial food sources and different temperatures.
