Patients that receive the same dose of a particular chemotherapeutic compound have differential susceptibilities to these drugs both in treatment efficacy and side effects. We use the model nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans* to identify conserved mechanisms of differential susceptibility to these compounds. Over the past five years, we generated data for animal responses to diverse chemotherapeutics using high-throughput assays that measure fecundity, growth rates, and pharyngeal pumping rates. We use the COPAS BIOSORT system from [Union Biometrica](http://www.unionbio.com/), along with other robotics to prepare and score assays.
