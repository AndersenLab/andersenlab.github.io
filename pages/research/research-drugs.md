To map sensitivities to drugs, we use high-throughput assays to rapidly phenotype a collection of over 400 worldwide natural _C. elegans_ isolates (for association mapping) or a panel of nearly 1200 recombinant inbred lines between the Bristol (N2) and Hawaii (CB4856) strains (for linkage mapping).

These high-throughput assays measure fecundity, growth rates, and pharyngeal pumping rates. Each trait allows us to determine different effects on the physiology of the animals. Growth rates and fecundity assay chronic exposures to compounds or stresses. By contrast, pharyngeal pumping measures the more acute response of the pharyngeal muscles and neurons to compounds or stresses. We use the COPAS Biosort system from [Union Biometrica](http://www.unionbio.com/), along with other robotics to prepare and score assays. See our pipeline in action <a href="/Research/Lab/">here</a>.

Our high-throughput phenotyping platform assays 30 conditions in 96 independent strains per week. These assays strictly control bacterial food, humidity, and temperature, eliminating much of the assay-to-assay variation and behavioral differences caused by standard agar plate assays.

These high-throughput assays give us the ability to identify natural variants or induced mutations at unprecedented speeds and with increased statistical power. Currently, we are measuring responses to diverse chemotherapeutics used on the human population, to anthelmintics used on parasitic nematode populations, to neuroactive compounds that mirror behavioral effects in humans, and to pesticides and heavy metals in which we do not know the genetic targets.
