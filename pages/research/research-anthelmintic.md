Using high-throughput assays that measure organismal fitness (offspring production, growth rate) and behaviors (feeding rate and paralysis), we are investigating how two nematode species, *Caenorhabditis briggsae* and *Caenorhabditis elegans*, vary in responses to anthelmintic (anti-nematode) compounds. Our goal is to identify resistance mechanisms conserved with parasitic roundworms to better treat infected people in developing countries. Our recent focus is on the genes that mediate avermectin and benzimidazole resistance across natural populations.
