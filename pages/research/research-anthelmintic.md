Using high-throughput assays that measure organismal fitness
(offspring production, growth rate) and behaviors (feeding rate and
paralysis), we are investigating how three clade V nematode species,
<em>C. briggsae</em>, <em>C. elegans</em>, and <em>C.
tropicalis</em> vary in responses to anthelmintic (anti-nematode)
compounds. Our goal is to identify resistance mechanisms conserved
with parasitic roundworms to better treat infected people in
developing countries. Our recent focus is on the genetic variants that
mediate macrocyclic lactone (ML) and benzimidazole (BZ) resistance across natural
populations. For MLs, we have identified at least five other
loci that control resistance in natural populations beyond variation
in the glutamate-gated chloride channel gene, <em>glc-1</em>. For
BZs, we found a new genomic locus involved in resistance and also high levels of natural heterogeneity in the benzimidazole target <em>ben-1</em>. We are collaborating with parasite research groups to
validate our <em>Caenorhabditis</em> findings in tractable parasitic helminths. Extending beyond <em>Caenorhabditis</em>, we have started quantitative genetics and new genomes for the turkey ascarid <em>Ascaridia dissimilis</em>. We believe that these projects will elucidate how ascarids become resistant to BZ drugs because the mechanisms seem to be independent from the standard beta-tubulin target gene.
