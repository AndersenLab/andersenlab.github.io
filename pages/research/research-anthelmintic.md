Using high-throughput assays that measure organismal fitness
(offspring production, growth rate) and behaviors (feeding rate and
paralysis), we are investigating how three clade V nematode species,
<em>Caenorhabditis briggsae</em>, <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em>, and <em>Caenorhabditis
tropicalis</em> vary in responses to anthelmintic (anti-nematode)
compounds. Our goal is to identify resistance mechanisms conserved
with parasitic roundworms to better treat infected people in
developing countries. Our recent focus is on the genetic variants that
mediate avermectin and benzimidazole resistance across natural
populations. For avermectin, we have identified at least five other
loci that control resistance in natural populations beyond variation
in the glutamate-gated chloride channel gene, <em>glc-1</em>. For
benzimidazoles, we found a novel role for small regulatory RNAs in
resistance. We are collaborating with parasite research groups to
validate our <em>Caenorhabditis</em> findings in tractable parasitic helminths.
