In addition to toxin responses, anthelmintics, behaviors, and development, we are measuring the abundances of mRNAs, small RNAs, proteins, and metabolites across hundreds of natural <em>C. elegans</em>, <em>C. briggsae</em>, and <em>C. tropicalis</em> isolates. We hope to use these data to better refine how organismal traits vary across populations and investigate evolutionary trends.
