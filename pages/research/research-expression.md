In addition to toxicant responses, anthelmintic resistance, behaviors, and development, we are measuring the abundances of mRNAs, small RNAs, proteins, and metabolites across hundreds of natural <em>C. elegans</em>, <em>C. briggsae</em>, and <em>C. tropicalis</em> isolates. We hope to use these data to better refine how organismal traits vary across populations and investigate evolutionary trends. Additionally, we have shown that these intermediate traits are statistical mediators that help us to more rapidly identify causal genetic loci underlying quantitative trait differences.
