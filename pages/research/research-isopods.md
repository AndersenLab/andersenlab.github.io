For most animals species, we do not understand the mechanistic basis for ecological dispersal. Using *Caenorhabditis elegans*, we are investigating how the species varies in the formation of the long-lived and hardy alternative larval stage (called dauer). Natural isolates from different geographic areas have different propensities to enter dauer and these differences likely affect species dispersal. 

We are also investigating the natural phoreses between *C. elegans* and the terrestrial isopod *Porcellio scaber*. Our recent efforts are focused on the optimization of sterile culture techniques and ispod genetic crosses.
