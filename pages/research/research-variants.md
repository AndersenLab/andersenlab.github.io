Because of the efforts of a number of highly dedicated scientists and citizen volunteers, we have amassed a large collection of more than 500 *C. elegans* strains from throughout the world. These strains represent nearly all known isolation locations where we have found this species. Our goals are to use this large strain collection to identify functional variation for a large number of traits and to understand more about the population genetic forces shaping the genome.

To this end, we deep sequenced all of these strains using the Illumina HiSeq platform (minimum 50x depth of coverage). This large sequence data set allows us to not only identify single nucleotide variants but to dig deeper into other classes of genetic variation, including insertion/deletions, transposon insertions, genomic rearrangements, microsatellite repeats, and copy number variants. We hope that these additional classes of variation will contribute to our understanding of how genetic variation contributes to phenotypic variation and genome evolution.
