Because of the efforts of a number of highly dedicated scientists and citizen volunteers, we have amassed a large collection of <em>C. elegans</em>, <em>C. briggsae</em>, and <em>C. tropicalis</em> wild strains from throughout the world. These strains represent nearly all known isolation locations where we have found these species. Our goals are to use this large strain collection to identify functional variation for many quantitative traits and to understand more about the population genetic forces shaping these genomes. As a first step, we are creating new telomere-to-telomere reference genomes and manually curated <em>de novo</em> gene models.

Next, we are actively deep sequencing all of the strains for each of the three species using Illumina and PacBio platforms. These large sequence data sets allow us to not only identify single nucleotide variants but to dig deeper into other classes of genetic variation, including insertion/deletions, transposon insertions, genomic rearrangements, short-tandem repeats, and copy number variants. We hope that these additional classes of variation will contribute to our understanding of how genetic variation underlies phenotypic variation and genome evolution.
