Our resequencing studies of _C. elegans_ have enabled us to identify sequence variants across the species. However, short-read sequence data enables for the exploration of sequence-based traits. Examples include but are not limited to telomere length, codon bias, rDNA copy number, and cell mitochondrial content. 

Investigating sequence-based traits enables us to identify factors directly involved in the maintenance, stability, and regulation of genomes. Additionally, we can learn about long-term processes that contribute broadly to differences in genomic content among individuals.
