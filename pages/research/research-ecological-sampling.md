To discover additional diversity in the three selfing species, <em>C. elegans</em>, <em>C. briggsae</em>, and <em>C. tropicalis</em>, and to identify new <em>Caenorhabditis</em> species, we sample wild nematodes from throughout the world. Our most recent focus is on natural diversity from the Hawaiian Islands, where we have found the most genetically diverse strains for all three species. These species are enriched in rotting fruits, flowers, and vegetal matter across a range of elevations and niches. Our longitudinal collections span multiple years, so we have cryopreserved and whole-genome sequenced strains from numerous habitats that can be connected to evolution of traits specific to Hawaiian niches. We continue to expand sampling and data collection from this field work to include microbiome sampling, measurements of ethanol content, metals, carbon content, and other environmental parameters.
