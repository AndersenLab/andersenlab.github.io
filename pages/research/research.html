<p>Model organisms provide the opportunity to experimentally test the correlations between genetic variation and trait differences across populations because of the ease of manipulation and powerful tools. However, most model organism research is based on a single wild-type strain background with little connection to natural variation, which is like studying a single person to make conclusions about the entire human species. Selfing <em>Caenorhabditis</em> species, including <em>C. elegans</em> , are isolated worldwide, have ample variation, rich ecological histories, and experimentally tractable traits and genomes. Therefore, these species provide the opportunities to identify the genes that vary among individuals and the molecular mechanisms for how genetic variation causes phenotypic differences. We can use variation within and across different <em>Caenorhabditis</em> species. Our lab uses a variety of genetic and genomic tools to discover the molecular mechanisms of evolutionary change in <em>Caenorhabditis</em> natural populations. The range of our research projects from genomes to organisms to ecology is shown above. Some of our ongoing projects are described below.</p>
