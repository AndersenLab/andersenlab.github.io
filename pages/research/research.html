<p>Model organisms provide the opportunity to experimentally test the correlations between genes and disease-related processes because of the high-level of conservation and the ease of manipulation. However, most model organism research is based on a single wild-type strain background with little connection to natural variation, which is like studying a single person to make conclusions about the entire human species. <em>C. elegans</em> is isolated worldwide and has genetic variation comparable to that of humans. Therefore, <em>C. elegans</em> provides the opportunity to identify the genes that vary among individuals and the molecular mechanisms for how genetic variation causes phenotypic differences. Our lab uses a variety of genetic and genomic tools to investigate the molecular, evolutionary, and quantitative genetics of <em>C. elegans</em> natural populations. Some of the ongoing projects are described below.</p>
