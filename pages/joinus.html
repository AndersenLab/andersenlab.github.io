		<h4>Prospective undergraduate researchers</h4>
		<p>Positions are available for undergraduate students to work part-time and learn what it is like to do science. We expect that most research experiences in the lab will culminate in an independent project before graduation. We are looking for students who have the following attributes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Freshmen or sophomores</li>
<li>Can work at least 12 hours per week during the academic year.</li>
<li>Can work full-time for one or more summers.</li>
<li>Are willing to intern, apply for summer scholarships, and perform research for credit.</li>
<li>Would be willing to continue in the lab for the remainder of their time at Northwestern.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please apply by email with a CV and a personal statement describing what research specifically interests you.</p>
