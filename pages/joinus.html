		<h4>Prospective undergraduate researchers</h4>
		<p>Positions are available for undergraduate students to work part-time and learn what it is like to do science. We expect that most research experiences in the lab will culminate in an independent project before graduation. We are looking for students who have the following attributes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Freshmen or sophomores</li>
<li>Can work at least 12 hours per week during the academic year. That time will be divided between independent projects and work to support the laboratory.</li>
<li>Can work full-time for one or more summers. These summer research positions can be funded by grants or volunteer.</li>
<li>Are willing to intern, apply for summer scholarships, and perform research for credit.</li>
<li>Would be willing to continue in the lab for the remainder of their time at Johns Hopkins University.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please apply by email with a CV or resume and a personal statement describing what research specifically interests you.</p>
