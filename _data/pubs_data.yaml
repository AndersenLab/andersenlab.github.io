        caption: "TelSeq telomere-length estimates from 448 Million Mutation Project strains sequenced
        at 75 bp and 100 bp were used to develop a linear model for converting TelSeq estimates.
        This transformation enabled us to convert TelSeq estimates using sequence data from 75 bp runs.
        The correlation between 75 bp and 100 bp estimates was r<sup>2</sup> = 0.723. "
