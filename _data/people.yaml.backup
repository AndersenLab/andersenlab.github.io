  description: I manage the lab's strain collection, generate sequencing libraries, monitor undergraduate research and aid in the high-throughput assay pipeline. I am also interested in determining natural variation in thermotolerance in <em>_(__C. elegans__)_</em> to understand mechanisms of stress response.

- first_name: Mostafa
  last_name: Zamanian
  description: My research broadly spans Neglected Disease Genomics and Drug Discovery. I'm currently working to develop genome editing technology for human pathogenic helminths. These tools will be leveraged to study anthelmintic drug resistance, and to help engineer novel platforms for therapeutic delivery.

- first_name: Sam
  last_name: Rosenberg
  description: I am interested in learning about quantitative traits in response to a variety of chemicals and compounds to learn about the underlying mechanisms of action in multicellular organisms. I manage the majority of the high-throughput assay pipeline, as well as handle much of the work with our COPAS Biosort large particle flow cytometer.

- first_name: Sarah
  last_name: Giuliani
  description: I support the lab maintenance, order supplies, coordinate meetings and Worm-community events, supervise work-study undergraduates, and manage our bacterial and plasmid stocks. I am interested in nematode natural variation in response to bacterial food and pathogen sensing, and also in developing assays to investigate putative hermaphrodite mate-searching behavior.
